## Desafio Sicredi - NTConsult

<p>
The app develops with Kotlin using the Marvel API with the main function of list and share informations of this app.  
The app is not completely done, but all the structure basis has been well-develop.

##Explanations

The glide usage is because another kind of framework to deal with images isn't as instable as glide. 

![comparison](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66300473/197620419-4802deaa-140a-4d1b-8db3-dc124a20056b.png)

The observable (RxJava) to deal with asynchronous data it's because probably the Sicredi project works with it, so, makes sense to apply this inside of the project.

MVVM has been the architecture because is the main and recommended by google to be used in android projects and can offer the hold of data at ViewModel that helps to never lose the information during the UI states.
